### Overview

In computer networking, localhost is a hostname that means this computer. It is used to access the network services that are running on the host via something called the loopback network interface. The loopback network interface refers to the routing of electronic signals, digital data streams, or flows of items back to their source without intentional processing or modification. This is primarily a means of testing the transmission or transportation infrastructure.

In telecommunications, loopback is a hardware or software method which feeds a received signal or data back to the sender. It is used as an aid in debugging physical connection problems.
