## Description

This repo has some of the most useful commands that are executable in shell.
The shell is the user-interface between the user and the kernel, which is the
operating system.

### Commands Used

* ``mkdir``, ``ls``, ``cd``, ``less``, ``file``, ``ln``, ``cp``, ``mv``, ``rm``,
``type``, ``which``, ``help``, ``man``, ``pwd``.

## Brief Synopsis

Every file in this repo is an executable script. The file will start with the following:
* ``#!/bin/bash``

To make a file executable, the ``chmod`` command was used.

## What each script does

* ``0-current_working_directory``: ``pwd`` prints the current working directory.
* ``1-listit``: ``ls`` prints a list of directory contents.
* ``2-bring_me_home``: ``cd`` changes the current directory to the home directory.
