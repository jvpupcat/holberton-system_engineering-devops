### Overview

A firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. It establishes a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted outside network, such as the internet.

Firewalls are often categorized as either network firewalls or host-based firewalls. There are different layers in a firewall that assist in filtering incoming and outgoing traffic.
