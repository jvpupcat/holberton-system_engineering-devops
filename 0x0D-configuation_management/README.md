## Overview

Configuration management refers to the process of systematically handling changes to a system in a way that it maintains integrity over time. Automation plays an essential role in server configuration management. Automation is the heart of configuration management for servers which is why it's common to also refer to configuration tools as Automation Tools or IT Automation Tools.

There are a number of configuration management tools available in the market such as Puppet. In this repo, we will be using Puppet. Although each CM tool have it's own characteristics, they are all driven by the same purpose: to make state matches the state described by your provisioning scripts.
