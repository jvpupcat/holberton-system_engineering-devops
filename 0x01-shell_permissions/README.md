## Description

The operating systems in Unix aren't just multitasking systems. They're also multi-user systems. 
Because of that, it's necessary to set permissions for owner, group owner, or the public or

directory, the user has control over access. Users can also belong to a group.

### Commands Used

* ``mkdir``, ``chmod``, ``id``,
